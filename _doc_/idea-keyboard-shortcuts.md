IntelliJ IDEA has keyboard shortcuts for most of its commands related to editing, navigation, refactoring, debugging, and other tasks. Memorizing these hotkeys can help you stay more productive by keeping your hands on the keyboard. All default shortcuts are [configurable](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-keyboard-and-mouse-shortcuts.html) and you can also assign shortcuts to any action that does not have them by default.
